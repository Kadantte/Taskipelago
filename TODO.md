## I am bad at organization but that's why I made this in the first place

so yeah i'm dumping todos here in a big sloppy mess
what are you gonna do about it?
take that Jira.


* Fix it reloading every time you complete a task
* Optimize, it can be quite laggy when lots of tasks.
* Add proper archipelago text console window (separate tab?)
* Notification history
* Prerequisite rewards for tasks rather than just prerequisite tasks (separate column with a field the same as the pre-requisite tasks, and a checkbox to enable/disable this feature)
* tasklock integration to force all task locks to be in the taskipelago world (generate tasklock yaml with plando logic included, warn user to enable plando items in host.yaml)
