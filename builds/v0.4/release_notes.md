# Version 0.4
No changes to the apworld logic were made, so the client should remain compatible with servers that generated using the 0.3 apworld.

## Features and Improvements
* Moved all pop-ups into a side panel, which fixes an issue with deadlocking and is generally cleaner

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug with rewards not being processed if a server has the same slot name as a previous server
